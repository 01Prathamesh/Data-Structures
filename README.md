## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of a variety of data structures, including but not limited to:

- **Arrays**
- **Stacks**
- **Linked Lists**
- **(Add any other data structures or algorithms here)**

Each implementation is designed to help you understand the underlying principles and operations of these data structures.

## Features

- **Array**: Static and dynamic array implementations.
- **Stack**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack with push, pop, and peek operations.
- **Linked List**: Singly and doubly linked list implementations.
- **(Additional features or data structures can be listed here)**

## Getting Started

To get started with the repository:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd data structures
    
3. Explore the code:

Browse through the different directories or files to find the implementations of various data structures.

## Usage

Instructions on how to use the code will vary depending on the language and data structure. Each directory or file should include its own README.md or documentation file with specific usage instructions.

For example:

  -Array: Check the Array/README.md for usage instructions.
  -Stack: Refer to Stack/README.md for detailed examples.
  -Linked List: See LinkedList/README.md for how to use the linked list implementation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, please follow these steps:
